# VTGPA
VTGPA is a Chrome Extension to display corresponding GPA data on the Virginia Tech Timetable of classes.
## Description
Using a Virginia Tech grade report generated from the University DataCommons, the CSV is parsed and turned into a RESTful web-service using Java and Spring. The Javascript is responsible for scraping each row of the timetable and performing a GET request on the server. The GPA data is then calculated specific to the instructor and course. A new column is added on the timetable and the relevant data is written in.
